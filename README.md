## 🧭 Who Am I...?

- I’m an **Information Science student from Mangalore, India**, focused on building  
**real-world, scalable web applications** rather than just demos.

- I enjoy working across the stack — from designing clean UI experiences to building  
robust backend systems and solving **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems.

- I believe in learning by **building, breaking, and rebuilding** — consistently.

- 🧠 Strengthening **problem-solving skills** through DSA and Iterative Learning
- 🚀 Building products that solve **real user problems**
